# KinveyVideoPlayer
Simple demo of an iOS video player integrated with Kinvey

## How to use

- From the root of the project, run `pod install` to install the dependencies.
- In `AppDelegate`, replace <appkey> and <appsecret> with your Kinvey App Key and Secret.
- In `ViewController`, replace the credentials with user credentials in your app.

The app assumes that your Kinvey File Store has some video files that can be played.
